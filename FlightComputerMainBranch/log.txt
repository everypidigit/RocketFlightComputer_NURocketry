    Daniyar:

    1.Included the following comment.
   /*

        THIS FILE INCLUDES JUST THE GYROSCOPE CODE FOR NOW

        Have to add:

        1. Accelerometer&Gyroscope //about 80% ready? gotta test a lot
        2. Barometer //taken by Alisher
        3. GPS code //dunno for now
        4. Parachute algorithm //
        5. SD card //done already, should optimize it, though
        6. Battery and control things //have no idea for now

        Also should implement Kalman filter in code. There is a library already.

        */
    2. Changed a lot of code so it can be more readable
